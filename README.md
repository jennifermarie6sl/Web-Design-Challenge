# Web Design Challenge
For this project we created a website using the weather data plot visualizations we created in a past project. 

In building this dashboard, we've created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We've also created a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

# Files
Requirements for the website to run:
html file for the website
css styling file
data.csv file
weather data plot visualization files

# File Use
The HTML file contains the website structure.  
A CSS styling file was used locally from Bootswatch using the Flatly design scheme. 
https://bootswatch.com/flatly/
The visuals used were saved locally. 
The data.csv file was converted in jupyter notebook to an html file.  The necessary navigation and styling code were then added to the HTML file. 

# Running the tests
Each page was tested to confirm the view as well as the links to the necessary pages. 

# Deployment
The webiste will be hoted using GitHub's website hosting option.
